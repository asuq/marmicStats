# Chocolate tasting data by Marmic C30

Chocolate bars were bought from Rewe and bio Markt. Each bar was from a different country of origin (two had no specific origin).

Testing:
Each bar was assigned a number and placed on a table separate from the group.
Every person tasted the chocolates in whatever order they wanted and filled in the table according to the number (without knowing where the chocolate was from or the brand).

Everyone cleaned their palate with water in between each tasting.

0 (no taste or smell), 1 (a hint), 5 (overwhelming/ all you can taste)
