Scent

Bar 1,2,0,1,0,3,2,2,"much sweeter, cleaner.  I am somewhere elegant and white."
Bar 2,0,1,2,3,3,1,1,"It is like a bouquet of freshly picked flowers.  Soil clings to the roots, dense and humic, rich in clay, the typical sort of soil you might find picking at grass at a park.  "
Bar 3,1,1,3,0,3,0,2,"immediate impression of wood, fresh pressed wood only a few months old, the wood is dry and brightly colored, sunlit through an open window in a spacious warehouse"
Bar 4,3,0,2,0,0,3,1,"rich leather and banana.  I smell as if I it is midnight, it is raining and the darkness is like a cloak.  I have come in from the rain into a shadowy hallway with mohagony walls."
Bar 5,0,0,1,3,5,2,0,"This one is interesting.  Vibrant and lush greenery.  I am walking along a path crossing through a rainforest.  I smell a river, wet and blue, rich in organic matter."
Bar 6,4,4,0,2,3,0,0,"I like this one quite a bit, rich bourbon and leather, I imagine i'm in a nice pub downtown at noon, it's christmas time, I have nowhere to be and the day is entirely open.  Something fresh, cold and minty on the back."
Bar 7,1,0,0,4,2,4,1,"this is a walk through a promenade on a summer day somewhere crowded, everyone is well dressed and the sun is out"
Bar 8,1,0,3,0,3,0,1,"I feel as though I am working on a homestead, digging up fence posts.  The grass is long and the soil rich.  It is Kentucky air.  A horse canters at the opposite end of the field at the forest's edge.  The morning dew cools my arms but the work warms me from within, creating an uncany tension that sends shivers down my legs.  I am relaxed."
Bar 9,3,4,3,0,2,0,2,"I feel as if im on on an old wooden ship transporting tobacco and theres a brisk wind carrying something blue"
Bar 10,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,"A subtler aroma.   nutty at the front, I don't get much else."

Taste

Bar 1,3,3,3,1,0,0,1,"Hm, much more muted.  this must be toe 100% or 99%.  I taste gray clay and rye whiskey.  The granules of salt open up the density."
Bar 2,0,0,1,1,0,3,2,"This is a clean, quite 'typical' taste.  I feel as though I am on a weekend vacation, a place everyone goes to, with my typical family on leave from my typical job, and I am happy about this.  There is something deeply content with this flavor.  Not really my favorite, but not horrible."
Bar 3,0,3,4,0,3,0,2,"little to no sweetness,  I am in a smoke clouded back room, i've been here often but not usually at this time"
Bar 4,5,4,1,0,1,2,2,"wow, quite a rich explosion at the front. This is deep and dark but brighter.  As if I creep through an alley, in shadow but under a mediterranean sun.  It is midday and the buildings are made of limestone.  There are fragrant vines creeping around the corner and one can hear the rich sounds of conversation, though muffled"
Bar 5,0,0,1,0,1,4,3,"Wow, quite interesting.  A strong nuttiness comes through.  I have come through the rainforest and sit on hard earth, and enjoy a collection of overripe fruit as the rich organic aroma of the forest wafts through the clearing, on the other side of which flows a broad river.  I watch the river as the sky tinges orange as afternoon comes."
Bar 6,2,4,0,0,3,0,3,"a rich flavor too, I think my favorite so far.  I still feel it is christmas, though now the eve, a fire is going and lots of conversation is bouncing around me, though i'm not listening.  It is cozy.  The mint is much reduced, and no longer cold but rather warm."
Bar 7,0,3,1,1,0,2,4,"more blue than its scent, I am in a relaxed and closed space.  Perhaps a coffee shop, there are soothing sounds in the background, humming machines"
Bar 8,2,2,,0,1,1,4,"Such a different flavor, but still rich.  I am cooking, the warm odor of drying earth and forest, rich in humics wafts up from the freshly picked produce.  The meat and herbs slowly break through the raw air, injecting it with something alive."
Bar 9,2,4,5,0,1,0,1,"I am walking through a woods, the earth is dark rich and loamy, i duck under a nut bush, the colors are like midnight velvet"
Bar 10,0,2,2,0,3,0,2,"the immediate image that came to mind was of crushed chestnut shell and roasted chestnut.  There is something botanical as well.  I am sharing christmas with some fancy white people from New England, they are wearing cashmere cardigans and laughing excessively, they've poured me a gin and tonic."
